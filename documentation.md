General operation:

<!> The big breakthrough and achievement has been creating some unique features with GTA San Andreas Multiplayer.

<!>  FiveM, being a more advanced engine, allowed easy installation and development of the code.

Advanced operations of our API:
Advanced operations are systems that require a more complex installation in an infrastructure, apart from being a more sensitive code to be misused, the exclusive use of this operation is passed to @Github Gated Access 

Context of advanced operations:

They work on SQL databases, on a new web user control panel, or create an existing one. 

<!>  To understand this context, we use an active 'BOT' to act as an intermediary between discord and your game or dedicated server.

<!>  Discord acts as an intermediary under your BOT or server (discord) and your dedicated server (game platform), allows the verification of linked roles and verification of the role token.
