 DISCORD + SERVER + PHP WEB FUNCTIONS
 

To access this content, the role within APIMOD.GG will be required @Github Gated Access  contact the administrators for more info on this feature.

New concept of user control panels  
<!> 02Auth PHP server side, web server and discord api.
<!> Discord helps you verify and the user of your main server becomes your Discord user, in this case the user could already link their characters to their Discord, the application working in this way

Note 02AUTH: This installation process can be complex and is only available for servers with SA-MP or GTA V SQL databases, the application allows the control of the character via SQL to be linked to the 'token' of the user who logged in by first time in 02Auth via PHP and Bot from your server.

Advanced operations of our API:
Advanced operations are systems that require a more complex installation in an infrastructure, apart from being a more sensitive code to be misused, the exclusive use of this operation is passed to @Github Gated Access 

Context of advanced operations: 

They work on SQL databases, on a new web user control panel, or create an existing one. 

<!>  To understand this context, we use an active 'BOT' to act as an intermediary between discord and your game or dedicated server.

<!>  Discord acts as an intermediary under your BOT or server (discord) and your dedicated server (game platform), allows the verification of linked roles and verification of the role token.
