## Server-side bot functions ##
<!> To create the functions on your server side you must have an active bot as a developer on Discord: https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started

<!> Some code we create does not depend on APIMOD.GG for its operation.

<!> In order to maintain our code functions and make them work online it is required: server-integration

## They currently use bots that are not multitasking ##
<!> Many of the bots released or created are not multitasking, that is, you have to have a set of bots that is too high to manage a server. Both in FiveM and in SA-MP, different functionalities are implemented, making the most of the available source code to be able to carry them out.

## Bot running by APIMOD.GG ##
<!> APIMOD.GG from its multifunctional bot can make it multifunctional and the bot is not online for a specific task, but to create several connections through webhooks, PHP and other online platforms to which it can be linked.

<!> The use of the multitasking bot is facilitated, both for verification and for internal management of the server through the bot, managing role tokens on the server.

<!> The bot is multifunctional, we base our codes on the architecture of SA-MP and FiveM.
